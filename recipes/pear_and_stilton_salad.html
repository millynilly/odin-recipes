    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gary Rhodes' perfect starter for a Boxing day lunch, made with lots of leftovers from the day before.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ripe pears</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
        <li>100g creme fraiche</li>
        <li>300g stilton, crumbled, room temperature</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp ginger syrup (from a jar of ginger in syrup)</li>
        <li>100g broken walnuts</li>
        <li>12 dates (Medjool are good), stoned and chopped</li>
        <li>Walnut oil for drizzling</li>
        <li>225g mixed salad leaves</li>
        <li>1 large watercress, divided into sprigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the pear quarters into thin slices and toss in a bowl with the lime juice to help protect their natural colour. Blend the crème fraîche with half the stilton, ginger syrup to taste, and enough water (3-4 tbsp) to give a smooth, thick coating consistency. (Don’t add too much water or it may separate.)</li>
        <li>Scatter the pear slices over six serving plates and follow with the walnuts, dates and remaining cheese. Can be prepared to this stage up to an hour ahead.</li>
        <li>Drizzle each salad with a little of the dressing and some walnut oil. Season with a grinding of pepper – you shouldn’t need salt, as the cheese is salty. Mix the salad leaves and watercress very lightly with just a bit more dressing – some leaves should be touched by the dressing, some untouched. Gently pile the leaves on top of each salad.</li>    
    </ol>
